Description
-----------

The Certification Validator Tool allows you to validate objects that have been published in a public certificate repository.
This tool is designed to help network operators make better routing decisions based on the RPKI data set.

This particular fork of the code includes *very preliminary support* for TAL files including 
references to multiple publication points as described in draft-ietf-sidr-multiple-publication-points-00
